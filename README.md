# Blender Knitting Simulation Plugin 🎨🧶

**Overview 🌟🔮**

The Blender Knitting Simulation Plugin is a powerful tool designed to simulate and optimize knitting patterns within Blender. This plugin enables designers to experiment with colors, generate multiple knitting pattern combinations, and efficiently render simulations. By automating the color selection and visualization process, it minimizes trial-and-error, reducing material waste and production time. 🎯🌿💡


**Features 🚀🧵**

- **Color Picker UI:** Select up to three colors for knitting directly within a PyQt-based interface.
- **Real-time Rendering:** Automatically updates the rendered output in Blender based on selected colors.
- **Multiple Color Combinations:** Generates alternative knitting patterns using all permutations of selected colors.
- **Blender Geometry Nodes Integration:** Assigns materials dynamically to the knitting object.
- **Batch Rendering:** Captures images from multiple angles for better visualization.
- **Grid Image Generation:** Creates a 3x3 grid of the rendered pattern for enhanced preview.


**Installation 🛠️🔧**

- Blender (version 4.1)
- Python 3.12
- Required Libraries: ```pip install bpy math mathutils itertools PyQt6 pillow PIL os```
- Extenstions: Install 'Blender Development' in VSCode to connect it with Blender
